# JBrowse for SARS-Cov-2 (coronavirus causing covid-9)

This project is used as one of the foundations of http://covbrowser.org/,  
a pastebin for SARS-CoV-2 genomes. It's a way to get a permanent, shareable
URL for a coronavirus isolate, displayed in a genome browser alongside the
reference strain, with variants highlighted and annotations that are
dynamically updated.

This repo contains the configuration files for a SARS-CoV-2 JBrowse instance
with several tracks as well as a Dockerfile for running that instance. A 
running version of that intance is at

  http://covid19.jbrowse.org/

and the Docker image can be obtained from Docker Hub:
